        <p>
            The header above is a link to a tool letting you compare the last 3 generations of Intel and AMD CPU's!
        </p>

        <h2><u>What is a CPU?</u></h2>
        <img src="CPU Main.jpg" width="800" height="450">
        <p>
            The Central Proccessing Unit also known as the CPU does exactly what the name states, it is main proccessing component of the entire computer.
            The CPU is what performs all of the proccessing needed for your computer to function including things like arithmetic and I/O functions.
            The CPU is located on the motherboard and on most desktop computers is a removable component that can be upgraded or changed.
        </p>

        <h2><u>Competitiors in the Market</u></h2>
        <p>
            There are two main competitiors in the CPU market and that is Intel and AMD. While there are different competitors in markets like phones were most proccessors are from companies like Apple, Qualcom, or Samsung in the laptop and desktop market place AMD and Intel are the main competitors. 
            While Apple has entered the market with their Apple Silicon in their desktop and laptop offerings these are only avaliable in Apple devices and hold a very small market share of the computer space and often don't follow any of the standards from other CPU manufactures. 
            AMD and Intel have been battling between eachother for decades now with different brands holding the top spot throughout those years. Most recently AMD has been holding the top spot for the last couple of years with their Ryzen line of CPU's however with the release of 12th gen CPU's from Intel they have
            been making a stride back to being the top in the market.
        </p>

        <h2><u>AMD</u></h2>
        <img src="AMD CPU.jpg" width="800" height="450">
        <p> 
            AMD's newest architecture is called Zen 4 which brings new improvements to thier existing Zen 3 architecture. Zen 4 however is very new so many of the chips still have not been released however the main desktop chips have been released by AMD. This is the reason archietectures like Zen 3 have a much larger
            CPU chip assortment as many of these chips have come out over the last couple years often time being updated as recently as 6 months ago with new additions to fill holes in AMD's lineup or give more options to consumers and manufactures.
            AMD's naming scheme is a bit more complicated then Intel's. For the Zen 3 and Zen 2 architecture only CPU's that have a G in the model name would include integrated graphics however with the addition of Zen 4 all CPU's include integrated graphics. 
            One of the other major differences is that all AMD CPU's are overclockable with the X designation added to some CPU models just indicating that the CPU is known to be capable of using more power and boosting to a higher specification then its none X counterpart. 
            The last difference in AMD's naming is a CPU that ends in X3D which in the tables may seem identical to their X counterpart however these CPU's have a higher amount of L3 Cache. This larger amount of cache has been known to increase the CPU's perormance in things like gaming and CPU intensive tasks so while on paper they seem identical to their X counterpart they do have differences in cache.

        <h2><u>Intel</u></h2>
        <img src="Intel CPU.jpg" width="800" height="450">
        <p>
            Intel's newest architecture is codenamed Raptor Lake is its 13th generation of CPU and it brings new improvements to Intel big-little CPU concept that was brought in during the 12th generation CPU's. This big-little concept is not new as it is common practice in things like mobile phones were its more power efficient to have lower 
            power CPU cores to do simpler tasks like loading webpages or just running background tasks while also having performance cores when you need CPU power like during gaming or intensive CPU workloads. This change in architecture can be seen when comparing 11th and 12th gen CPU's were a distinction is made
            between just normal cores and then with 12th gen the separation between performance and efficiency cores. On Intel's naming scheme for their CPU's anything that ends with a K on the model number is a CPU that is overclockable meaning you can increase the speed of the CPU after the fact if you have a motherboard that supports it.
            Then usually the only difference between a CPU that ends in K and KF is that KF means it has no integrated graphics which can be useful for troubleshooting a graphics card issue however CPU's labeled KF will be cheaper than their K counterparts.
