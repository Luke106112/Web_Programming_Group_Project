                The MasterWatt Maker MIJ is certified as 80 PLUS TITANIUM, but it actually exceeds the requirements for the certification.
The exclusive analog design is one of the things that helps it exceed the 80 Plus Titanium efficiency rating of 94%.
Cooler Master's premium Silencio FP fan with 135mm sickle blade fan technology generates 25% more air pressure than regular fans, while being quieter at the same time.
The Loop Dynamic Bearings (LDB) are self lubricating and dust proof, so you don't have to worry about the fan failing.
At up to 50% load the MasterWatt Maker 1200 MIJ operates in fanless mode, giving you 600W of noiseless power.
The MasterWatt Maker 1200 MIJ offers cleaner power input than competing products.
This can in term not only prolong the lifecycle of the PSU itself, but it can enhance the life of your PC components as well.
